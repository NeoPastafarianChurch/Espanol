La iglesia NeoPastafaria es una iglesia computacional 100% compatible con la Iglesia
del Monstruo de Espagueti Volador como fue revelada a nosotros por el profeta
Bobby Henderson

Como iglesia exaltamos las cualidades positivas de una congregaci√≥n, 
As a church we openly cherish the good qualities of having a congregation, to pursue
as a group a better quality of life and to participate in helping the community. Although
we are not necesarilly atheists (many of us are), we recommend the book: Religion for 
Atheists, a non believers guide to the uses of religion, by Alain De Bottom, 
to get more information on this stance. These ideas have been implemented
in various contexts, most notably the sunday assembly, for our tastes 
though, these are very serious folks.

One of the core beliefs of a neoPastafarian is that since dogma cannot be proven,
and dogmas of different sorts are incompatible, then dogma doesn't have a 
legitimate place in discussion of public policy in an open society, any decision 
made based on dogma will be an imposition on the minority. An open society has
the responsibility to make decisions based on an humanistic ethics based on
scientific fact, an ethics and morals that encompass the religions harbored
in its society, not the other way round.

This is why we strongly believe in the need to separate dogma from fact in all religions
(religious dogma just wont go away), and the need that all religions openly acknowledge 
this difference, we therefore stress, by example, the absurdity of dogma. We are all
free to believe whatever we like, so long as it doesn't affect others, this 
freedom has to be respected, not the belief though, as NeoPastafarians we
are the first to accept mockery of our credo, and demand that all religions that
participate in an open society: Christian, Jusaism, Islam, Buddhist, do so
as well.

We dream of a world in which all religions accept that their dogma is unprovable and
exclude it from political action, and emphasize their culture and traditions (so long
as they are humane). In this respect, the NeoPastafarian church is an activist 
organization.
